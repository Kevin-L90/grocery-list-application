# My Personal Project

## Grocery List Application

This is my back-up idea. I've run out of time to complete phase 1 of my original idea, so I'm going to do this instead.
I'm only doing this for the sake of completing on time, and will attempt to finish my original idea at a later date.

I got inspired to make this application after going to the grocery store and completely forgetting what I came there
for. This lead to me buying many unnecessary items and other items in excess amounts.

- As a user, I want to be able to add an item to my grocery list.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the complete grocery.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove items from the grocery list.
- As a user, I want to be able to reduce or increase the quantity wanted from the list.
- As a user, I want to be able to have quantities by each item.
- As a user, I want my grocery list to automatically save.
- As a user, I want my grocery list to automatically load.

Please use valid inputs. There is no handling system in place. So if you input an invalid integer, the code will break.
Same applies if you input a String when it requests an Integer.

Additionally, there may be a bug that the program does not react to the input given. I do not know why this bug exists
and the TA I asked did not know either. The bug is sometimes not reproducible. Therefore, I suggest you just repeat the
input if the bug occurs.

# Phase 4: Task 3

Looking at my UML class diagram, I see that it is extremely messy, however I do not believe that it is an issue with the
code, and instead I am bad at making UML diagrams. I could reasonably split the App class into several classes as to
make it easier to understand. This would be especially important given that I was planning to add more functionality.
Perhaps it would be split so that display would have its own class. The same can also be said about groceryPanel and
addPanel.
